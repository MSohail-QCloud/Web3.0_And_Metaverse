// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
//  It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
//  Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
//   such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the
//    information was stored correctly.

// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. 
//Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. •
// Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. •
// Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 
//You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


arr_car=["car","Motor bike","Cycle"]
list_example=["I love","i want to buy", "i have a"]

for (i=0; i<arr_car.length; i++){
    console.log(list_example[i]+" "+arr_car[i])
}

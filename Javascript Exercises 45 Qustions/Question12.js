//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const arr_name=["Ali", "Suleman", "Atif"];

for (i=0; i<arr_name.length;i++){
    console.log("Hello "+arr_name[i]+", Hope you are doing well")
}
